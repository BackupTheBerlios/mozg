15/10/99 Alexy Filin
	made mix of "chunk" with "on-line", so added num_for_chunk in
	signatures of putBackprop() and putQuickprop();

10/10/99 Alexy Filin
	made Quickprop and Rprop for RBF;

08/10/99 Alexy Filin
	added extensions in Quickprop and Rprop, chunk training for Backprop
	and Quickprop;

07/10/99 Alexy Filin
	placed all parts of the project in the namespace mozg to remove
	possibility of names conflicts with another programs for them joint
	using,

03/10/99 Alexy Filin
	added Qprop, Rprop;

29/09/99 Alexy Filin
	added cross-entropy error for th and atg output function;
	
	added cross-entropy error for nonstandard output function on output
	layer, for it wrote void putNStdFuncParams (mozgflt,mozgflt) in
	MLPerceptron.hh;

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////// mozg-0.4.3 /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

28/09/99 Alexy Filin
	added log-squared error, temperature for each layer.

27/09/99 Alexy Filin
	added new function -- answerMessage(), it is called by learnNet(). It
 	is intended for error observation and checking "on fly".

	remove test error message from testNet(). Now the function returns
	test error.

24/09/99 Alexy Filin
	added Cross-Entropy energy function, added in signature of
	putLParams() energy function switch.

19/09/99 Alexy Filin
	made network learning for random order of used learning examples; it
        helps to improve network generalization.

18/09/99 Alexy Filin
	added temperature of neuron's output function, to manage network
	learning by sharpening/softening of the error surface.

16/09/99 Alexy Filin
	added bias term in the neuron's net; the term may be very usefull in
        some problems;

	changed layers' learning rate; now they are computed by rule of fan-in
	in putLParams(), the rule is:
               layer's_learning_rate = learning_rate / layer's_inputs_number.

13/09/99 Alexy Filin
	renamed propInput() by propInputs().


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
////// mozg-0.3.5 /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

20/07/99 Alexy Filin
	wrote types.hh, replaced float by mozgflt and int by mozgint for easy
	floating (float,double,long double) and integer (int,long,...) types
	choosings;

	wrote MLPOutFunc.[hh,cc] for easy inserting of nonstandard neuron
        output function.


19/07/99 Alexy Filin
	simplified net constructor, now its signature:
	MLPerceptron (int number_of_layers,
                      int* num_outs_layers,
                      int* func_number,
                      float begin_weights_sigma);
	
	moved learning parameters initialisations in new functions:
	putLParams (float learning_rate,
                    float RBF_sigma_minimum) for "vanilla" backpropagation rule
	putLParams (float RBF_sigma_minimum,
		    float mom_term_coef,
		    float lang_noise_begin_dispersion,
		    float lang_noise_disp_decr_coef,
		    float weight_decay_coef) for backprop with extensions;
	
	hid epoch and learning vector loops in learnNet (), its signature:
	learnNet (float** linp,
                  float** lout,
                  int lssize,
                  int epnum,
                  int pepnum) learn network without testing,
	learnNet (float** linp,
                  float** lout,
                  int lssize,
                  int epnum,
                  int pepnum,
                  float** tinp,
                  float** tout,
                  int tssize); learn network with testing;

	added
	testNet (float** tinp,
                 float** tout,
                 int tssize)  for network test,
	propInput (float* invec,
                   float* outvec) propagate input vector through network,
	propInput (float** invecarr,
                   float** outvecarr,
                   int ssize) propagate inp. vec. massive through network.

14/07/99 Alexy Filin
	renamed interface functions:
	PutInputs      -> putInputs
	GetOutputs     -> getOutputs
	PropLayer      -> propLayer
	PropForward    -> propForward
	CompOutErrors  -> compOutErrors
	BackPropErrors -> backpropErrors
	AdjustWeights  -> adjustWeights
	LearnNet       -> learnNet

13/07/99 Released version 0.1.2, considerably extended README.

28/06/99 Released version 0.1.1,
	removed const bool first_iteration from signature of
	AdjustWeights(const bool),
	the same for LearnNet(float*, const bool)

10/06/99 Released first version (0.0.1).
